# PPEVision-Advanced AI-Based PPE Detection

PPEVision is an innovative project aimed at bolstering safety in various industrial and construction environments through the utilization of advanced computer vision technology. The project centres around the deployment of a YOLOv5 model, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, for the real-time identification of essential Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), namely **helmets** and **reflective vests**, worn by individuals within the monitored area.
## Features

- Live Detection
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross-platform
- Image and Video Detection
- Voice Alert
- Email Alert with Image
- Log generation
- Support for up to 10 cameras simultaneously or manual camera configuration

## Libraries Used in the Project

The following libraries were used throughout the project:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- opencv-python
- jupyter
- streamlit
- Pillow
- pyaudio
- win32com

## Installation

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- Python is installed
- Git is installed

Follow these steps to install the necessary libraries for the project:

1. Use Git to clone the project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder where the project has been copied:

    ```bash
    cd <project_folder>
    ```

3. Install the required libraries using the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning:** 
Please be cautious while executing commands in your terminal. Ensure that you are in the correct directory. Occasionally, some libraries may not get installed automatically. If this happens, you may need to install them manually.

After completing the installation, you need to navigate to the project folder in your command prompt before running the `HOME.py` file. Use the `cd` command to change your current directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd <project_folder>
```
```bash
Streamlit run HOME.py
```
